"""Local-only access gating for an *unprotected* TwiCC instance.

When no password is configured, TwiCC has no way to authenticate anyone, so it
must not be silently reachable over the network. These helpers decide whether
an incoming request / WebSocket connection is a *direct local* one (loopback
peer, no proxy in front) and — combined with the password / opt-out settings —
whether a non-local request to an unprotected instance must be refused.

The IP classification reuses ``twicc.artifacts.proxy.classify_ip`` (the same
loopback / lan / public logic the artifact network broker uses for host
validation).

Trust model — deliberately the **opposite** of ``views._get_client_ip``: that
helper *trusts* forwarding headers to recover the real client IP for
rate-limiting; here we must never let a header *grant* access. A connection
counts as local only when the raw TCP peer is loopback **and** no forwarding
header is present, so a forged ``X-Forwarded-For`` can only ever push the
decision toward refusal (fail-safe), and a reverse proxy / tunnel in front
(which adds such a header) is correctly treated as remote.
