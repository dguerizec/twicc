// frontend/src/utils/presence.js
// Human-presence heartbeat: tells the backend whether a human is actively at
// this TwiCC client, so it can hold "away-only" external (Apprise) notifications
// while the user is here and send them only once the user is away.
//
// A page can only observe its own tab, so presence is approximated per device
// class and the backend applies a per-class grace window (see twicc/presence.py):
//   - desktop: report genuine input activity (mouse/keyboard/scroll). Input
//     events only reach the focused tab, so they double as a "TwiCC is
//     foregrounded and the user is interacting" signal; when the user switches
//     tab/app or walks away (even leaving the tab focused), the pings stop and
//     the backend's grace eventually expires.
//   - mobile/touch: report a foreground heartbeat on a timer (being in the
//     foreground counts as present, even without touching) and stop when the
//     tab is backgrounded — the OS suspends it anyway.
//
// All pings are fire-and-forget; the send function no-ops when the WS is down,
// so pings simply resume after a reconnect.

import { readonly, ref } from 'vue'

// Cadence well under both backend grace windows (mobile = 30s, desktop = 5min),
// so a single dropped ping never prematurely expires presence.
const PING_INTERVAL_MS = 10000

// How long after the last desktop input we still consider a human present here.
// Mirrors the backend desktop grace window (twicc/presence.py). Used by
// isLocallyPresent() to gate auto "mark as read" so a desktop left open+focused
// but unattended stops marking the session read (otherwise it would steal the
// global last_viewed_at from a device where the user actually is, e.g. a phone).
const DESKTOP_PRESENCE_WINDOW_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000

// Touch-primary devices (phones, tablets) are classified as "mobile": their OS
// suspends background tabs and shows no desktop notification banner, so the

// a touchscreen still exposes a fine pointer and stays "desktop".

// Reactive single source of truth for local presence — "a human appears to be
// actively at THIS client right now". Drives BOTH the auto "mark as read" gate
// (isLocallyPresent) and the UI WebSocket dot, so they can never disagree.
//   - desktop: true while genuine input (mouse/keyboard/scroll) happened within
//     the grace window. Starts false (no input yet) — a freshly loaded but
//     untouched desktop reads as "not present", which is exactly what we want:
//     it must not steal the global last_viewed_at from the device the user is
//     actually on. Flips true on the first input, false again grace-ms later.
//   - mobile: mirrors tab visibility. A visible phone is being looked at; it
//     locks/suspends otherwise. So on mobile this matches isPageActive() and
//     introduces no behavior change.
