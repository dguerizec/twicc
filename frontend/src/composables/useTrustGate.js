// frontend/src/composables/useTrustGate.js
//
// Global gate run before starting a new session in a project: make sure the
// project's trust is settled (or recorded) first. A single ProjectTrustDialog is
// mounted at the app root and registered here; every "new session" entry point
// calls `ensureProjectTrust(projectId)` and proceeds only when it returns a
// truthy result.
//
// Flow (docs/plans/2026-06-09-project-trust-design.md §5):
//   1. resolve locally from the store (no round-trip when already resolved)
//   2. else ask the backend (it may seed from the provider configs)
//   3. else prompt the user; persist the decision via /trust/decide/
// On any error we proceed (the gate must never hard-block starting a session;
// the project simply stays unresolved and is asked again next time).
//
// The result is AUTHORITATIVE for the caller: `{ state: true|false|null }` —
// what the gate actually settled on — or `false` when the user cancelled the
// dialog. Callers MUST pass `state` down to the draft seeding instead of
// re-resolving the store, which may not have caught up with a backend seed yet
// (the broadcast races the draft creation — the root cause of the "session
// silently seeded with the untrusted default" incident).
