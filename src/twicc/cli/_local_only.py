"""Canonical set of CLI commands that stay local to the host.

These root commands are never exposed over the RPC HTTP API and (later) are
never forwarded over the ``--remote`` CLI forwarder. They only make sense
against the local machine running the command.

This is a leaf constant module: it must import nothing from the ``cli`` or
``rpc`` packages so that both can depend on it without an import cycle.

# - "password", "token": interactive secret management (must run on the host).
# - "claude", "codex": provider passthroughs (spawn local provider CLIs).
# - "run": local process exec.
# - "whoami": host-bound caller identity (resolved from the local process).
