# Shared-Queue DB Writer Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace the per-provider register/unregister registry of the unified DB consumer with two process-wide shared queues drained by a single permanent consumer, extracted into its own `db_writer.py`.

**Architecture:** The consumer becomes a permanent task owned by `run_server` (boot → app shutdown), draining one shared `queue.Queue` (initial sync) and one shared `multiprocessing.Queue` (compute). Producers no longer register anything — each message carries its own `provider`. Completion is signalled by a sentinel pushed last by the producer: the initial-sync marker carries its own `asyncio.Event`; the compute side uses a small `dict[Provider, Event]` armed before each run (mp.Queue cannot transport an Event). Orchestrator `shutdown()` becomes blocking — it awaits the real end of the initial-sync thread, not just the wrapping coroutine.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.13, Django 6 ORM, asyncio, `multiprocessing` (spawn), SQLite (WAL).

---

## Context

This plan continues the `feature/centralize-db-writes` branch (9 commits, `1a8e5a6b`..HEAD). Those commits introduced a unified consumer with a `register_*`/`unregister_*` registry. A Codex review found a critical bug (#1): on shutdown / hot-toggle, the orchestrator's `finally` unregisters the initial-sync entry while the `asyncio.to_thread` producer thread is still alive and still pushing payloads onto an orphaned queue → lost writes + zombie thread.

The fix chosen during design: drop the routing registry entirely. A permanent consumer + process-wide shared queues mean a late-pushing thread pushes onto a queue still drained by a still-alive consumer — the lost-writes condition disappears mechanically. The remaining concern (a zombie thread overlapping a new run on hot-toggle) is handled by making `shutdown()` block on the real thread end.

## Decisions (resolved during design)

- **`apply_session_complete` → `@staticmethod`.** Verified it never uses `self` (only the parameter and the `self_cost` field name). The consumer calls `BaseSessionCompute.apply_session_complete(msg)` directly; no per-provider `compute` instances needed in the consumer.
- **Hot-toggle.** `arm_compute_completion(provider, ...)` overwrites the provider's state + event on every run. Correct as long as runs never overlap — guaranteed by blocking `shutdown()`. A `logger.warning` fires if a previous run's state is still present when arming (surfaces a lifecycle bug).
- **Commits.** Two: Commit A = mechanical rename of `background_task.py` → `background_compute_task.py`. Commit B = the whole refonte (atomic — the system only works once every piece is in place).

## File Structure (after this plan)

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/twicc/providers/db_writer.py` | **NEW.** The permanent unified consumer. Owns the two shared queues, the queue payload vocabulary (NamedTuples), the consumer loop, the `_apply_*` write handlers, and the completion API (`arm_compute_completion`, `get_initial_sync_queue`, `get_compute_result_queue`, `start_unified_consumer`, `stop_unified_consumer`). |
| `src/twicc/providers/background_compute_task.py` | **RENAMED** from `background_task.py`. After the refonte, holds only the *compute producer*: `ComputeContext`, `compute_worker_main` (subprocess), `start_compute_process`, `start_background_compute_task`, `stop_background_task`. No consumer code. |
| `src/twicc/sync_helpers.py` | Producer-side initial-sync helpers only: `read_session_items_from_file`, `check_file_has_content`, `SessionItemsToInsert`. Payloads move out to `db_writer.py`. |
| `src/twicc/providers/claude_code/initial_sync.py` | Initial-sync producer (Claude Code). Imports payloads from `db_writer.py`. |
| `src/twicc/providers/codex/initial_sync.py` | Initial-sync producer (Codex). Imports payloads from `db_writer.py`. |
| `src/twicc/providers/claude_code/orchestrator.py` | Wires the shared queue into `_initial_sync_task`; blocking `shutdown()`. |
| `src/twicc/providers/codex/orchestrator.py` | Same as Claude Code. |
| `src/twicc/providers/compute_base.py` | `apply_session_complete` becomes `@staticmethod`; `compute_session_metadata` tags its messages with `provider`. |
| `src/twicc/cli/run.py` | `start_unified_consumer()` before `start_all()`; `stop_unified_consumer()` at global shutdown. |

**Import / spawn rule (critical):** `background_compute_task.py` is re-imported by the spawn subprocess *before* `django.setup()`. It must never import Django models at module level (already the case). It will need `arm_compute_completion` / `get_compute_result_queue` from `db_writer.py` — those imports MUST be **lazy** (inside functions), never top-level, so `db_writer.py` is not dragged into the subprocess. `db_writer.py` itself is never imported by the subprocess, but keeps the lazy-model-import discipline anyway.

## Task 1: Mechanical rename `background_task.py` → `background_compute_task.py`

**Files:**
- Rename: `src/twicc/providers/background_task.py` → `src/twicc/providers/background_compute_task.py`
- Modify: `src/twicc/providers/claude_code/orchestrator.py` (import line)
- Modify: `src/twicc/providers/codex/orchestrator.py` (import line)

- [ ] **Step 1: Rename the file with git**

Run: `cd <worktree> && git mv src/twicc/providers/background_task.py src/twicc/providers/background_compute_task.py`

- [ ] **Step 2: Update the two importers**

Both orchestrators import from `twicc.providers.background_task`. Change to `twicc.providers.background_compute_task`. Find them:

Run: `cd <worktree> && grep -rn "providers.background_task\|providers import background_task\|background_task import" src/`

Expected: matches only in `claude_code/orchestrator.py` and `codex/orchestrator.py`. Update each `from twicc.providers.background_task import (...)` → `from twicc.providers.background_compute_task import (...)`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Sanity check — no stale reference remains**

Run: `cd <worktree> && grep -rn "background_task" src/ ; echo "---done---"`
Expected: no match (only `---done---`). If any match remains, fix it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Compile**

Run: `cd <worktree> && python -m py_compile src/twicc/providers/background_compute_task.py src/twicc/providers/claude_code/orchestrator.py src/twicc/providers/codex/orchestrator.py && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit A**

```bash
cd <worktree>
git add src/twicc/providers/background_task.py src/twicc/providers/background_compute_task.py src/twicc/providers/claude_code/orchestrator.py src/twicc/providers/codex/orchestrator.py
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor(compute): rename background_task.py to background_compute_task.py

The file holds the background compute producer. The unified DB consumer
that grew inside it is about to move into its own db_writer.py, so the
name is renamed up front to reflect its real (and soon only) role.

Mechanical rename + import updates, no behaviour change.

```

> Everything below is **Commit B** — do not commit between Task 2 and Task 10. Intermediate states are intentionally incoherent (e.g. duplicated code between Task 3 and Task 5). Each task still py-compiles the files it touches.

---

## Task 2: `apply_session_complete` → `@staticmethod`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/twicc/providers/compute_base.py` (the `apply_session_complete` method)

- [ ] **Step 1: Convert to staticmethod**

Locate `apply_session_complete`. It currently reads:

```python
    @transaction.atomic
    def apply_session_complete(self, msg: dict) -> None:
```

Change to:

```python
    @staticmethod
    @transaction.atomic
    def apply_session_complete(msg: dict) -> None:
```

(Decorator order matters: `@staticmethod` outermost, then `@transaction.atomic`, so the transaction wraps the plain function.)

The body uses no `self` — leave it byte-for-byte identical otherwise. Existing test callers (`provider_compute.apply_session_complete(msg)`, `get_compute().apply_session_complete(msg)`) keep working: Python allows calling a staticmethod through an instance.

- [ ] **Step 2: Compile**

Run: `cd <worktree> && python -m py_compile src/twicc/providers/compute_base.py && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

---

## Task 3: Create `db_writer.py` — payloads, state, lifecycle, completion API

**Files:**
- Create: `src/twicc/providers/db_writer.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the module (part 1 — header, payloads, state, lifecycle, API)**

Create `src/twicc/providers/db_writer.py` with exactly this content (Task 4 appends the consumer loop + handlers to the same file):

```python
"""
Unified DB writer.

A single permanent coroutine that owns every database write coming from the
two boot-time "big jobs": the per-provider initial sync (producers run in
``asyncio.to_thread`` threads) and the background metadata compute (producers
run in ``multiprocessing`` subprocesses). Both push onto process-wide shared
queues; this consumer drains them and applies every write inside
``transaction.atomic`` from one place — so the SQLite write lock is never
contended between providers, nor between the initial-sync phase and the
compute phase.

Lifecycle: started once by ``run_server`` at boot (before any provider
orchestrator starts), stopped once at application shutdown (after every
orchestrator has shut down). It strictly outlives every producer. Provider
orchestrators never start/stop it and never register anything for routing —
each message carries its own ``provider``.

Completion signalling: a producer pushes a sentinel *last*, after all its
real messages. Because the queues are FIFO, draining the sentinel proves
every preceding message of that run has been applied.
- Initial sync: ``InitialSyncDoneMarker`` carries its own ``asyncio.Event``
  (the queue is intra-process, the Event travels by reference).
- Compute: the ``done`` message comes from a subprocess and cannot carry an
  Event, so ``arm_compute_completion`` hands the orchestrator a fresh Event
  kept in ``_compute_done_events`` and set when the ``done`` is drained.

Import discipline: this module is never imported by the spawn subprocess.
Django model imports are still done lazily inside functions, matching the
convention of ``background_compute_task.py``.

- [ ] **Step 2: Compile**

Run: `cd <worktree> && python -m py_compile src/twicc/providers/db_writer.py && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

> Note: this `db_writer.py` reproduces the broadcast/activity logic that currently lives in `background_compute_task.py`'s `_process_compute_message` / `_finalize_entry` / `_handle_compute_done` / `_broadcast_project_updated` / `_flush_pending_activities`. When Task 5 strips that file, those become the source of truth here. Keep them byte-equivalent in behaviour.

## Task 5: Strip `background_compute_task.py` to the compute producer only

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/twicc/providers/background_compute_task.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Remove the consumer code now living in `db_writer.py`**

Delete from `background_compute_task.py`:
- `_ConsumerEntry`, `_InitialSyncEntry` dataclasses
- `_consumer_entries`, `_initial_sync_entries`, `_unified_consumer_task` module state
- `register_compute_consumer`, `unregister_compute_consumer`
- `register_initial_sync_entry`, `unregister_initial_sync_entry`
- `_ensure_unified_consumer_running`
- `_unified_consumer_loop`
- `_process_compute_message`, `_process_initial_sync_message`
- `_apply_create_session_payload`, `_apply_update_session_payload`, `_apply_mark_sessions_stale_payload`, `_apply_update_project_metadata_payload`
- `_finalize_entry`, `_finalize_initial_sync_entry`
- `_handle_compute_done`, `_broadcast_project_updated`, `_flush_pending_activities`
- The constants `PROJECT_BROADCAST_INTERVAL`, `BATCH_ACTIVITY_COUNT` (moved to `db_writer.py`)

Keep: `ComputeContext`, `_resolve_factory`, `stop_background_task`, `_set_pdeathsig_linux`, `compute_worker_main`, `start_compute_process`, `start_background_compute_task`.

Drop the imports used **only** by the removed consumer code: `from collections import defaultdict`, `from datetime import date as date_cls`, `from channels.layers import get_channel_layer`, `from twicc.workspaces import auto_add_project_to_workspaces`, and `from django.db import transaction` (every `_apply_*` function moves to `db_writer.py`; no retained function uses `transaction`).

**KEEP** these — the retained code still uses them: `from asgiref.sync import sync_to_async` and `from twicc.startup_progress import broadcast_startup_progress` (both used heavily by the rewritten `start_background_compute_task` in Step 6), `import orjson` (used by `compute_worker_main`), `from contextlib import suppress` (used by `stop_background_task`), plus `asyncio`, `importlib`, `logging`, `multiprocessing`, `queue`, `dataclass`/`field`, `TYPE_CHECKING`, `Provider`, `current_provider`. Verify with the compile.

- [ ] **Step 2: `ComputeContext` — drop the per-context `result_queue`**

`ComputeContext` currently has `result_queue: _mp_ctx.Queue = field(default_factory=_mp_ctx.Queue)`. Remove that field — the compute result queue is now the process-wide shared one. Keep `command_queue` (still per-worker, one-way main→worker), `worker_stop_event`, `process`, `provider`, `compute_version`, `compute_factory`.

- [ ] **Step 3: `start_compute_process` — pass the shared result queue to the worker**

`start_compute_process(ctx)` builds the `_mp_ctx.Process(target=compute_worker_main, args=(ctx.command_queue, ctx.result_queue, ...))`. Replace `ctx.result_queue` with the shared queue obtained lazily:

```python
def start_compute_process(ctx: ComputeContext) -> None:
    if ctx.process is None or not ctx.process.is_alive():
        from twicc.providers.db_writer import get_compute_result_queue  # lazy import
        result_queue = get_compute_result_queue()
        ctx.worker_stop_event = _mp_ctx.Event()
        ctx.process = _mp_ctx.Process(
            target=compute_worker_main,
            args=(ctx.command_queue, result_queue, ctx.worker_stop_event, ctx.compute_factory),
            daemon=True,
            name="compute-worker",
        )
        ctx.process.start()
        logger.info(f"Started compute worker process (PID: {ctx.process.pid})")
```

- [ ] **Step 4: `stop_background_task` — do not close the shared result queue**

`stop_background_task` currently calls `ctx.result_queue.cancel_join_thread()` / `.close()`. The result queue is now shared and permanent — it must NOT be closed when one provider stops. Remove the two lines that cancel/close `result_queue`. Keep the `command_queue` cancel/close (that one is still per-context). Keep all the process join/terminate/kill logic.

- [ ] **Step 5: `compute_worker_main` — tag every emitted message with `provider`**

The worker emits messages onto the (now shared) result queue. Every message MUST carry `'provider'` so the consumer can route. The worker has `compute` in scope, hence `compute.provider.value`.

- The `error` message: add `'provider': compute.provider.value`.
- The `done` message: change `result_queue.put(orjson.dumps({'type': 'done'}))` to `result_queue.put(orjson.dumps({'type': 'done', 'provider': compute.provider.value}))`.
- The `session_complete` messages are emitted inside `compute.compute_session_metadata(session_id, result_queue)` — Task 8 handles that in `compute_base.py`. (`compute_worker_main` itself only emits `error` and `done`.)

- [ ] **Step 6: `start_background_compute_task` — use `arm_compute_completion`**

Currently it does `register_compute_consumer(ctx, worker_done_event, display_session_ids=..., total_display=...)`, then `try: ... await worker_done_event.wait() ... finally: unregister_compute_consumer(...) ; stop_background_task(ctx)`.

Replace with: arm the completion Event via the lazy-imported `arm_compute_completion`, no register/unregister:

```python
async def start_background_compute_task(ctx: ComputeContext) -> None:
    from twicc.providers.db_writer import arm_compute_completion  # lazy import
    from twicc.projects import load_project_directories, load_project_git_roots
    from twicc.core.models import Session, SessionType

    provider_value = ctx.provider.value

    total_to_compute = await sync_to_async(Session.objects.filter(
        provider=ctx.provider,
    ).exclude(compute_version=ctx.compute_version).count)()

    if total_to_compute == 0:
        logger.info("Background compute: no sessions to process")
        total_display = await sync_to_async(
            Session.objects.filter(provider=ctx.provider, type=SessionType.SESSION).count
        )()
        await broadcast_startup_progress(
            "background_compute", total_display, total_display,
            provider=provider_value, completed=True,
        )
        return

    sessions_to_display = await sync_to_async(lambda: set(
        Session.objects.filter(provider=ctx.provider, type=SessionType.SESSION)
        .exclude(compute_version=ctx.compute_version)
        .values_list("id", flat=True)
    ))()
    total_display = len(sessions_to_display)

    await broadcast_startup_progress(
        "background_compute", 0, total_display, provider=provider_value
    )
    await sync_to_async(load_project_directories)()
    await sync_to_async(load_project_git_roots)()

    start_compute_process(ctx)

    # Arm the completion Event with the unified DB writer. The writer sets it
    # when it drains this provider's 'done' message.
    done_event = arm_compute_completion(ctx.provider, sessions_to_display, total_display)

    logger.info(f"Background compute task started ({total_to_compute} sessions to process)")
    try:
        session_ids_to_compute = await sync_to_async(lambda: list(
            Session.objects.filter(provider=ctx.provider)
            .exclude(compute_version=ctx.compute_version)
            .order_by("-mtime")
            .values_list("id", flat=True)
        ))()
        for session_id in session_ids_to_compute:
            if ctx.stop_event.is_set():
                break
            ctx.command_queue.put({"session_id": session_id})
        logger.info(f"Background compute: all {len(session_ids_to_compute)} sessions sent to worker")
        ctx.command_queue.put(None)

        await done_event.wait()

        await broadcast_startup_progress(
            "background_compute", total_display, total_display,
            provider=provider_value, completed=True,
        )
    finally:
        stop_background_task(ctx)

    logger.info("Background compute task completed")
```

Keep `broadcast_startup_progress` imported at module top (still used here).

- [ ] **Step 7: Compile**

Run: `cd <worktree> && python -m py_compile src/twicc/providers/background_compute_task.py && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

---

## Task 6: Move payloads out of `sync_helpers.py`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/twicc/sync_helpers.py`
- Modify: `src/twicc/providers/claude_code/initial_sync.py` (import line)
- Modify: `src/twicc/providers/codex/initial_sync.py` (import line)

- [ ] **Step 1: Delete the payload NamedTuples from `sync_helpers.py`**

Remove `CreateSessionPayload`, `UpdateSessionPayload`, `MarkSessionsStalePayload`, `UpdateProjectMetadataPayload`, `InitialSyncDoneMarker` (they now live in `db_writer.py`). Keep `SessionItemsToInsert`, `check_file_has_content`, `read_session_items_from_file`. Drop the now-unused `from twicc.core.enums import Provider` if nothing else in the file uses it (check — `read_session_items_from_file` does not; `SessionItemsToInsert` does not).

- [ ] **Step 2: Repoint the two initial_sync.py imports**

Both `claude_code/initial_sync.py` and `codex/initial_sync.py` currently import the payloads from `twicc.sync_helpers`. Split the import: `check_file_has_content` + `read_session_items_from_file` stay from `twicc.sync_helpers`; the payloads come from `twicc.providers.db_writer`:

```python
from twicc.sync_helpers import check_file_has_content, read_session_items_from_file
from twicc.providers.db_writer import (
    CreateSessionPayload,
    MarkSessionsStalePayload,
    UpdateProjectMetadataPayload,
    UpdateSessionPayload,
)
```

`InitialSyncDoneMarker` is imported by the *orchestrators* (Tasks 8/9), not the `initial_sync.py` producers — leave it out of these import lists.

- [ ] **Step 3: Compile**

Run: `cd <worktree> && python -m py_compile src/twicc/sync_helpers.py src/twicc/providers/claude_code/initial_sync.py src/twicc/providers/codex/initial_sync.py && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

---

## Task 7: Wire the permanent consumer into `run_server`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/twicc/cli/run.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Start the consumer before the orchestrators**

In `run_server`, locate `await orchestrators.start_all(...)`. Immediately before it, add:

```python
    from twicc.providers.db_writer import start_unified_consumer, stop_unified_consumer
    start_unified_consumer()
```

(`start_unified_consumer` must run on the event loop, before any orchestrator — and therefore any producer — starts.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Stop the consumer at global shutdown**

Find where `run_server` shuts the orchestrators down (the shutdown path after `server.serve()` returns / after the shutdown event). After every orchestrator has been shut down, add:

```python
    await stop_unified_consumer()
```

It must run AFTER the orchestrators' `shutdown()` so no producer is still pushing. Read the surrounding shutdown code and place it on the correct path (there may be a `finally`/cleanup block — match the existing structure).

- [ ] **Step 3: Compile**

Run: `cd <worktree> && python -m py_compile src/twicc/cli/run.py && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

---

## Task 8: Claude Code — wire shared queue, blocking shutdown; `compute_session_metadata` provider tag

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/twicc/providers/claude_code/orchestrator.py`
- Modify: `src/twicc/providers/compute_base.py` (`compute_session_metadata`)

- [ ] **Step 1: `compute_session_metadata` — tag `session_complete` with `provider`**

In `compute_base.py`, `compute_session_metadata` pushes messages onto `result_queue`. There are **two** `result_queue.put(...)` sites in that method, and **both** dicts must carry `'provider': self.provider.value` (`compute_session_metadata` is a method, `self.provider` is available):

1. The `session_complete` payload (around line 1941).
2. The `error` payload — `{'type': 'error', 'session_id': ..., 'error': 'Session not found'}` (around line 1587).

If the `error` dict is **not** tagged, `db_writer._process_compute_message` hits `if provider_value is None: return` and silently swallows the error instead of logging it. Grep inside the method for `result_queue.put` to confirm you tagged both.

- [ ] **Step 2: `_initial_sync_task` — use the shared queue, keep the thread future**

In `claude_code/orchestrator.py`, the current `_initial_sync_task` creates its own `queue.Queue()`, calls `register_initial_sync_entry`, runs `await asyncio.to_thread(sync_all, sync_queue, ...)`, pushes `InitialSyncDoneMarker`, awaits `worker_done_event`, and `unregister`s in a `finally`.

Replace with: take the shared queue from `db_writer`, keep an explicit reference to the `to_thread` future on `self`, and let `shutdown()` (Step 3) do the blocking wait. No register/unregister.

```python
    async def _initial_sync_task(self) -> None:
        """Run sync_all() in a thread, pushing payloads onto the shared queue."""
        from twicc.providers.db_writer import get_initial_sync_queue, InitialSyncDoneMarker

        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        provider_value = self.provider.value

        total_sessions = await asyncio.to_thread(_count_total_sessions)
        await broadcast_startup_progress(
            "initial_sync", 0, total_sessions, provider=provider_value
        )

        progress = {"current": 0}

        def on_session_progress(session_id: str, idx: int, total: int):
            progress["current"] += 1

Add `self._sync_thread_future: asyncio.Future | None = None` to `__init__`.

> Why no `try/finally` here: with the permanent consumer, a thread that keeps pushing after a cancel pushes onto a still-drained queue — no lost writes. The zombie-thread / overlap concern is handled by `shutdown()` (Step 3) blocking on `_sync_thread_future`.

- [ ] **Step 3: `shutdown()` — block on the real thread end**

In `shutdown()`, after `self._sync_stop_event.set()` and before/around the existing `_cancel_task(self._sync_task, ...)`, make the shutdown wait for the producer thread itself:

```python
        self._sync_stop_event.set()
        ...
        # Cancel the coroutine, then wait for the underlying producer THREAD
        # to actually finish (asyncio.to_thread does not kill the thread on
        # cancel — only awaiting its future proves it stopped).
        if self._sync_task is not None:
            await _cancel_task(self._sync_task, "Initial sync task")
        if self._sync_thread_future is not None and not self._sync_thread_future.done():
            with suppress(Exception):
                await asyncio.shield(self._sync_thread_future)
            self._sync_thread_future = None
```

This is what makes `shutdown()` honest: it does not return (the orchestrator does not reach the `stopped` phase) until the initial-sync thread has actually exited. Combined with the front-end blocking start/stop outside the stable phases, no new run can overlap an old one.

`import` needed: `from contextlib import suppress` (add if absent).

- [ ] **Step 4: Drop the register/unregister imports**

`claude_code/orchestrator.py` imports `register_initial_sync_entry` / `unregister_initial_sync_entry` from `background_compute_task`. Those no longer exist — remove them from the import. Keep `ComputeContext`, `start_background_compute_task`, `stop_background_task`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Compile**

Run: `cd <worktree> && python -m py_compile src/twicc/providers/claude_code/orchestrator.py src/twicc/providers/compute_base.py && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

## Task 9: Codex — same wiring as Claude Code

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/twicc/providers/codex/orchestrator.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: `_initial_sync_task` — shared queue + thread future**

Apply the same transformation as Task 8 Step 2 to `codex/orchestrator.py`'s `_initial_sync_task` (the Codex version has the same shape — `asyncio.to_thread(sync_all, sync_queue, ...)`, marker, done wait). Use `provider=self.provider` (Codex). Add `self._sync_thread_future` to `__init__`.

- [ ] **Step 2: `shutdown()` — block on the real thread end**

Apply the same transformation as Task 8 Step 3 to `codex/orchestrator.py`'s `shutdown()`. As in Task 8 Step 3 this needs `from contextlib import suppress` — `codex/orchestrator.py` does not import it today, so add it.

- [ ] **Step 3: Drop register/unregister imports**

Remove `register_initial_sync_entry` / `unregister_initial_sync_entry` from the `background_compute_task` import in `codex/orchestrator.py`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Compile**

Run: `cd <worktree> && python -m py_compile src/twicc/providers/codex/orchestrator.py && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

## Task 10: Global sanity check + Commit B

**Files:** none (verification only)

- [ ] **Step 1: No stale symbol references anywhere**

Run: `cd <worktree> && grep -rn "register_compute_consumer\|unregister_compute_consumer\|register_initial_sync_entry\|unregister_initial_sync_entry\|_ConsumerEntry\|_InitialSyncEntry\|_unified_consumer_loop\|_ensure_unified_consumer_running" src/ ; echo "---done---"`
Expected: only `---done---` (no match). Any match is a leftover — fix it.

- [ ] **Step 2: No stale `background_task` references**

Run: `cd <worktree> && grep -rn "background_task" src/ ; echo "---done---"`
Expected: only `---done---`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Compile the whole touched set**

Run:
```bash
cd <worktree> && python -m py_compile \
  src/twicc/providers/db_writer.py \
  src/twicc/providers/background_compute_task.py \
  src/twicc/providers/compute_base.py \
  src/twicc/sync_helpers.py \
  src/twicc/providers/claude_code/initial_sync.py \
  src/twicc/providers/claude_code/orchestrator.py \
  src/twicc/providers/codex/initial_sync.py \
  src/twicc/providers/codex/orchestrator.py \
  src/twicc/cli/run.py && echo OK
```
Expected: `OK`

- [ ] **Step 4: Import smoke test**

Run: `cd <worktree> && TWICC_DATA_DIR=$PWD uv run python -c "import django, os; os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE','twicc.settings'); django.setup(); from twicc.providers import db_writer, background_compute_task; from twicc.providers.claude_code import initial_sync as ccs, orchestrator as cco; from twicc.providers.codex import initial_sync as cxs, orchestrator as cxo; print('imports OK')"`
Expected: `imports OK` (this proves no circular import and no `AppRegistryNotReady`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit B**

```bash
cd <worktree>
git add src/twicc/providers/db_writer.py \
        src/twicc/providers/background_compute_task.py \
        src/twicc/providers/compute_base.py \

refactor(db): replace consumer registry with shared queues + permanent writer

Drop the per-provider register/unregister registry of the unified
consumer. The consumer becomes a permanent task (db_writer.py) owned by
run_server: started before the orchestrators, stopped after them. It
drains two process-wide shared queues — one queue.Queue for initial
sync, one multiprocessing.Queue for compute — created by the writer and
handed to producers. No routing registry: every message carries its own
provider.

Completion is signalled by a sentinel the producer pushes last (FIFO
guarantees every earlier message was applied first):
- initial sync: InitialSyncDoneMarker carries its own asyncio.Event;
- compute: arm_compute_completion() hands the orchestrator an Event the
  writer sets on the provider's 'done' message (mp.Queue cannot carry
  an Event).

This kills the critical shutdown bug: a producer thread that keeps
pushing after a cancel now pushes onto a queue still drained by a
still-alive consumer — no lost writes. To stop a zombie thread from
overlapping a new run, orchestrator shutdown() now blocks on the real
end of the asyncio.to_thread producer (it keeps the thread future and
awaits it), not just on the wrapping coroutine being cancelled.

apply_session_complete is now a @staticmethod (it never used self) so
the writer applies compute writes without per-provider compute
instances. The payload NamedTuples move to db_writer.py — the consumer
owns the queue vocabulary; producers import it.

## Risks & notes for the implementer

- **Codex review findings #2–#7 are NOT in scope here.** This plan only addresses #1 (shutdown / lost writes) by way of the architecture change. `Project.mtime` regression (#2), swallowed errors (#3), `_sync_titles_at_boot` outside the consumer (#4), queue backpressure (#5), `exists()→open()` race (#6), `register_project_sync` inside atomic (#7) remain open and should be tackled in follow-up commits.
- **`stop_unified_consumer` ordering is load-bearing.** It must run after every orchestrator `shutdown()` has returned. Since `shutdown()` is now blocking on the producer threads, "after shutdown" genuinely means "no producer alive". Get Task 7 Step 2 placement right.
- **The shared `mp.Queue` survives provider stop/restart.** `stop_background_task` must not close it (Task 5 Step 4). Only `command_queue` is per-context and still closed.
- **`_compute_done_events` / `_compute_states` are keyed by provider with no run-id.** Correct only while runs never overlap. The blocking `shutdown()` is what guarantees that — if the `arm_compute_completion` warning ever fires in logs, a lifecycle assumption broke.
- **`asyncio.shield` in `shutdown()`**: shielding the thread future means a second cancel of `shutdown()` itself won't abandon the wait. If `sync_all` ignored `stop_event` forever the shutdown would hang — acceptable, because `sync_all` checks `stop_event` between every project and every session, so the wait is bounded.
- **No tests:** this project ships without a test suite (per CLAUDE.md). Verification is py_compile + the import smoke test + manual restart by the user. Do not add a test scaffold.
