"""
Background task for periodic Codex command discovery.

Codex commands are surfaced as **skills** under the ``$`` activation
prefix. Every 5 minutes the task asks the Codex app-server for the
current skill catalogue (``skills/list`` JSON-RPC, fed with the cwds
of every active Codex project so repo-scoped skills come back too),
maps each skill onto a ``Command`` row, and hands the desired state
to the shared diff/apply helper.

The mapping is centralized in :func:`_skill_to_desired_entry`; in
particular:

- ``scope=Repo``: the row is anchored to the project whose cwd
  matched the entry — ``project_id`` non-NULL.
- ``scope=User``: ``project_id=NULL`` (global). Plugin-shipped
  skills (whose ``name`` carries a ``<plugin>:`` namespace) populate
  ``plugin_name``.
- ``scope=System`` / ``scope=Admin``: ``project_id=NULL`` and
  ``is_builtin=True`` (these are runtime-shipped catalogues, the same
  picker affordance as Claude's CLI built-ins).
- Disabled skills are skipped — they have no place in a "what can I
  run" picker.

User / System / Admin skills appear in **every** ``SkillsListEntry``
(they're independent of the cwd), so duplicates are absorbed by the
"first occurrence wins" rule when populating the desired dict.
