"""Single source of truth for every provider's state.

Two layered concerns live here:

1. **Intent** (persisted) — does the user *want* this provider on?
   Derived from the `disabledProviders` key in the synced settings file:

   - Key absent → no choice made yet (initial install / upgrade from
     pre-feature version). ``get_enabled_providers()`` returns an empty
     set, the orchestrator starts nothing, and the frontend opens the
     activation dialog.
   - Key present → a provider is *enabled* if it is registered (compiled
     in) AND not in the list.

2. **Runtime** (in-memory) — where is the provider in its lifecycle right now?
   Four states cover the full cycle:

   - ``stopped``   — orchestrator never started, or its ``shutdown()`` is done.
   - ``starting``  — ``orchestrator.start()`` is in progress.
   - ``running``   — ``start()`` returned successfully; operational.
   - ``stopping``  — ``shutdown()`` is in progress.

The two layers are connected by hot toggles: enabling a provider transitions
its runtime state ``stopped → starting → running``; disabling it transitions
``running → stopping → stopped``.

Why both live in the same module:

- They answer the same broad question: "what is the state of this provider?"
- Most callers need both — endpoints that pilot a provider's SDK / agent
  must check that it is *enabled* AND *running* before acting. That's what
  :func:`ensure_provider_running` does in one call.
- The error type is shared (:class:`ProviderDisabledError`), and so is the
  exception code propagated to the frontend (``provider_disabled``).

Read-only paths (DB queries, parsing of historical session content) do NOT
need to gate on this module — see spec §6.3.
