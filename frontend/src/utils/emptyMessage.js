/**
 * Whether an assistant message with no content must be replaced by the notice
 * above, or dropped entirely (rendered as nothing).
 *
 * The notice only earns its place when the empty message is the whole block:
 * the assistant turn would otherwise render nothing at all between two user
 * messages. As soon as the block displays anything else — an earlier text, a
 * tool use, a group toggle — that context already shows the turn happened, so
 * narrating the emptiness is noise (a common shape in orchestration: the agent
 * messages another session, then closes its turn with an empty message).
 *
 * Both flags come from the visual-item block flags (see the store's
 * ``recomputeVisualItems``), so they reflect what is actually displayed in the
 * current display mode, not the raw JSONL.
 *
 * @param {boolean} isBlockStart - Nothing is displayed before it in its block.
 * @param {boolean} isBlockEnd - Nothing is displayed after it in its block.
 * @returns {boolean} true to render the notice, false to render nothing.
