"""
Cron restart: re-launch Claude Code sessions that had active cron jobs.

Called at TwiCC startup (restart_all_session_crons) and at runtime when a
process with active crons dies from a non-manual cause (_restart_crons_for_session
in ClaudeCodeAgentManager). Both paths use the same restart_session_crons() function.

Relaunching the *process* is the part only TwiCC can do; re-arming the jobs is
mostly the CLI's job now. Since CLI 2.1.110 a resume replays the transcript and
resurrects every unexpired job with its original id and ``created_at``
(:meth:`SessionCron.is_restored_on_resume`). So the message we send on resume
asks Claude to recreate *only* the recurring jobs that went past the CLI's
7-day window — asking for the others would double them. The rows of the
resurrected ones are re-parented onto the new run by
:func:`reattach_crons_and_purge_old_runs` so the expiry monitor keeps renewing
them.

The cross-provider boot cleanup of stale :class:`ProcessRun` rows lives in
:mod:`twicc.agent.process_run_cleanup` and runs *before* this module is
invoked; by the time :func:`_prepare_restarts` reads the table, the only
surviving Claude Code rows are those whose
:meth:`ClaudeCodeHelpers.should_keep_dead_process_run` returned ``True``
(= rows that still have :class:`SessionCron` rows attached).

    :class:`ProcessRun` table — orphan rows are gone, per-session duplicates
    are collapsed to a single oldest row, and only rows the Claude Code

    Three concerns remain, all resolved by deleting the now-pointless
    :class:`ProcessRun` (cascading its crons) instead of restarting:

    - Sessions whose JSONL was deleted on disk between TwiCC instances. The
      boot cleanup keeps them because their cron rows still exist; the
      per-session initial sync removes the matching :class:`Session` row but
      doesn't know about ProcessRun, so we catch that case here.
    - Archived sessions. Archiving is a deliberate stop and drops these rows
      itself (``core.services.session_update.apply_session_archived_change``),
      so a surviving row means the archive predates that behaviour — never
      resurrect a session the user put away.
    - Sessions left with nothing to restore. The boot cleanup only checks that
      cron rows *exist*; a session whose every cron is a one-shot that already
      fired has nothing to bring back, and without this its row would survive
      every boot (the purge that would clear it only runs on a USER_TURN that
      never comes).
