/**
 * The task a parent agent hands to a subagent (Codex multi-agent v2).
 *
 * Codex models it as an inter-agent message rather than a user message,
 * but in the receiving thread it plays the role a human's prompt plays in
 * a top-level session — so the backend classifies it as a USER_MESSAGE
 * (see the Codex compute's ``compute_item_kind``) and it renders in the
 * same bubble, through the same markdown pipeline as any other message.
 *
 * The body normally travels encrypted (a Fernet token in a sibling
 * content block), leaving the task name as the only readable trace of
 * what was asked. Rather than an empty bubble or a ciphertext dump, we
 * compose the markdown the renderer would have received if Codex had
 * written it in the clear.
 *
 * The envelope's routing header (sender, agent paths) is deliberately
 * dropped: internal plumbing, with nothing in it for the reader as long
 * as subagents are shown one level at a time.
