"""Create or adopt a git worktree of a project, registered as a linked Project.

Single orchestration point shared by:

- the HTTP endpoints ``POST /api/projects/<id>/worktrees/`` (create a new
  worktree) and ``POST /api/projects/<id>/worktrees/adopt`` (adopt an
  existing one) (:mod:`twicc.views`), and
- the CLI ``create-session`` flow — ``--worktree-branch`` (create) or
  ``--worktree-path`` alone (adopt) — where
  :func:`twicc.core.services.session_creation.create_session_from_payload`
  calls one of them before creating the session so it lands in the worktree.

Both entry points are transport-agnostic: they return a
:class:`twicc.projects.ProjectMutationResult` (``success`` flag, the new
worktree ``project_id`` + ``Project`` instance, or a list of structured
errors). Callers map the error ``code`` to their own surface — an HTTP
status for the view, a ``rejected`` drop-status for the watcher.

The actual ``git worktree add`` (:func:`twicc.git.create_worktree`) runs
OUTSIDE the DB write lock — the subprocess can take seconds; only the
get-or-create of the source project (when the caller knows it by path
only, e.g. the CLI) and of the new worktree project run under the lock,
mirroring the granularity the HTTP endpoint used before extraction.
Adoption runs no subprocess at all — the worktree already exists on disk.
