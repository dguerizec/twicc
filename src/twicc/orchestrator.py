"""
Per-provider orchestrators and their cross-provider registry.

Each provider owns the lifecycle of its own async/background tasks
(JSONL watcher, sync loops, agent manager, ...) inside a subclass of
:class:`BaseOrchestrator`. The CLI server entry point doesn't know which
tasks any given provider runs — it just calls
``start_all`` / ``request_thread_stop_all`` / ``shutdown_all`` on the
:class:`OrchestratorRegistry`, mirroring the registry pattern used for
helpers (``ProviderHelpersRegistry``), agent managers
(``AgentManagerRegistry``) and WS handlers
(``WSConsumer.PROVIDER_HANDLERS``).
