"""Boot-time cleanup of stale :class:`ProcessRun` rows across providers.

Runs once at TwiCC startup, before any provider's agent-restart logic. The
in-process registry is empty at that point, so every persisted ``ProcessRun``
necessarily belongs to a previous TwiCC instance — its persisted ``state``
column is stale (still ``ASSISTANT_TURN`` / ``USER_TURN`` / ``STARTING`` if
the previous process died mid-flight). The cleanup consolidates the table
in three steps inside one ``transaction.atomic`` block so the DB never
exposes a half-cleaned state to concurrent readers:

1. Force every non-``DEAD`` row into ``DEAD`` with a fresh
   ``last_state_change_at``. Bulk ``UPDATE``, scoped to the lifecycle column
   so other writers' decisions remain correct.
2. Group surviving rows by ``(provider, session_id)``; for each session,
   keep the oldest row by ``started_at`` and DELETE the rest (cascade
   deletes their crons). The dedup matters mostly for Claude Code, where
   a crash mid-cron-restart can leave both the original cron-bearing row
   and a fresh restart attempt; for providers without that pattern the
   group always has size 1, so the loop is a no-op.
3. For the surviving row, defer to the provider's
   :meth:`BaseProviderHelpers.should_keep_dead_process_run`. Default
   helpers return ``False`` (every other provider), Claude Code returns
   ``True`` iff there is still at least one :class:`SessionCron` attached
   — those are the rows the cron-restart loop will pick up downstream.

The cleanup runs through the DB writer (single-writer path) via
:func:`submit_async_job`, mirroring the convention of
:class:`twicc.providers.db_writer._MarkSessionsIndexedJob`.
